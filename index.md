I am a Research Engineer at [Veris AI](https://veris.ai), working on simulation environments for enterprise agents. I graduated with a M.Sc. in Computer Science from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) in August 2025, where I was supervised by [Prof.&nbsp;Reihaneh Rabbany](http://www.reirab.com/) at the Complex Data Lab.

## Research Interests

I am mainly interested in LLM agents, particularly in agent optimization, post-training, LLM personas, reasoning, and planning.

Previously, I worked at the intersection of machine learning and human sciences, focusing on computational social science, network science, and NLP. By combining these disciplines, I uncovered insights from real-world data, studying social networks and bridging theory and practice.
