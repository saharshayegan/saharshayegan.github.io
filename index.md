I am a research master student at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), working on Computational Social Science, Network Science, and Natural Language Processing.

I enjoy working at the intersection of machine learning and human sciences. By combining these disciplines, I try to uncover valuable insights from real-world data. Currently, my focus lies in the study of social networks, where I aim to identify patterns by bridging between theory and practice.

## Research Focus

Under the supervision of [Prof. Reihaneh Rabbany](http://www.reirab.com/), my research focuses on:

- **Graph Neural Networks** - Developing novel architectures for social network analysis
- **Natural Language Processing** - Processing textual data in social contexts
- **Social Network Analysis** - Understanding community formation and information diffusion
- **Computational Social Science** - Applying computational methods to social phenomena

## Education

- **McGill University** - M.Sc., Computer Science (2022-Present)
- **Amirkabir University (Tehran Polytechnic)** - B.Sc., Computer Science (2018-2022)
