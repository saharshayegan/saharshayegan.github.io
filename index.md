## Research
I work on the combining graph neural networks and natural language processing to get a better understanding of social networks.
### Research Focus
I started my M.Sc. at McGill and Mila in 2022, working under the supervision of Reihaneh Rabbany. My research focuses on network science, computational social science, and graph representation.  
I enjoy working at the intersection of machine learning and human sciences. By combining these disciplines, I try to uncover valuable insights from real-world data. Currently, my focus lies in the study of social networks, where I aim to identify patterns by bridging between theory and practice.
